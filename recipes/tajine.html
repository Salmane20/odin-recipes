    <h2>Tagine of lamb & merguez sausages</h2>
    <p><em>A famous Moroccan casserole</em> named after the clay dish it's cooked in and containing strong, fragrant <strong>flavours</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 lamb shanks or a 1kg/2lb 4oz piece lamb or mutton shoulder (if using shoulder ask the butcher to cut it into 10cm chunks on the bone)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp olive oile</li>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 red onions, sliced</li>
        <li>12 dried prunes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>juice ½ lemon</li>
        <li>2 preserved lemons, homemade (see recipe below) or bought, pulp scooped out, rinsed and finely sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Marinade</strong> - For the marinade, roast the spices in a dry pan for a couple mins until fragrant. Put remaining marinade ingredients in a blender and process to a smooth paste, then add the roast spices and blend again to combine. Place the lamb in a large bowl and pour over the marinade. Leave in the paste overnight, or for at least 2 hrs to absorb all the flavours.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook</strong> - Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. In a large roasting tin, big enough to fit the meat in one single layer, heat the oil and place over a high heat on the hob. Remove the meat from the marinade, wiping off and reserving any excess, then brown shanks on all sides in the hot oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Marinade</strong> - Add remaining marinade to the dish along with the carrots, onions and prunes, then pour in 1 litre water. Cover the dish tightly with foil and cook in a low oven for 3½-4 hrs until the meat is tender and falling away from the bone. Add the honey, lemon juice and seasoning and keep warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry</strong> - If using, fry the sausages until cooked through, then add to the tagine. Serve the meat in a large bowl with the sauce spooned over, then scatter with the preserved lemons and mint, and serve the harissa on the side.</li>
    </ol>
